    #    This was found in the wild in Image-ExifTool. However, I am
    #    unable to reproduce this. Investigation shows that the relevant
    #    code is in fact tickled in at least one case
    #    (lib/Image/ExifTool/Geotag.pm:), but that module does not
    #    enable warnings. So this is a true positive.
    #
    # my $x; goto FOO; $x = do { say 'Boo!'; FOO: 1 } + 2;
    #    That is, you can `goto ...` a block that forms the left-hand
    #    side of a binary operator. This is actually documented as being
    #    legal in `perldoc -f goto` for Perl v5.42. It is illegal (and I
    #    think throws a fatal exception) if it's the right-hand side. No
    #    idea about chained operators, and my personal opinion that
    #    anyone who uses this construct should be chained to the
    #    computer and forced to maintain this code as long as he or she
    #    lives ... and after, if that can be arranged.
    #    FIXME this appears to be a misunderstanding of `perldoc -f
    #    goto`. Perl's t/op/goto.t appears to test for this, but the
    #    tested code is
    #
    #    eval {
    #        goto __GEN_2;
    #        my $sent = do {
    #            __GEN_2:
    #        };
    #    };
    #    is $@,'', 'goto the first parameter of a binary expression [perl #132854]';
    #
    #    which still warns.
    #
    # OTOH the following cases which parse as a PPI::Structure::Block DO
    # warn:
    #   {; ... } -- a bare block
    #   do { ... } -- though this is NOT a block for (e.g.) `last` etc
    #   while ( ... ) { ... }
    #   sub { ... } -- though this was a different error
    #   for ( ... ) { ... }

=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::ControlStructures::ProhibitGotoIntoBlock - Do not enter a block via a goto.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Entering a block via a C<goto> is unsupported, and will become fatal in
Perl v5.44. Before that, the behavior is deprecated as of Perl v5.37.10,
and will issue a warning as of that version. The problem is that if you
enter a block via a C<goto>, any initialization of that block will not
occur.

The behavior of C<goto> in the presence of duplicate labels is
undocumented, but Perl's F<t/op/goto.t> tests that the first duplicate
in a given scope is the target of the goto, and when duplicates are in
multiple scopes the preference is same scope, inner scope (which is to
be fatalized, maybe) and outer scope. This policy makes no attempt to
duplicate this exact logic. Instead it declares a violation if and only
if the only possible targets for a F<goto> are in an inner scope.

=head1 AFFILIATION

This policy is not part of any package.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

This policy is not configurable except for the standard options.
