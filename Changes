    Add test for goto into first (sic) operand of expression. This
    duplicates what is in t/op/goto.t.

    Update policy doc and comments for my current understanding of goto.

    Test for goto into if-elsif-else blocks. I originally thought that
    these did not warn because a couple of the Image-Exif modules do
    this, but the tests do not warn. The gotos are in fact executed, but
    the relevant modules do not enable warnings.

    Add test for given/when.

    Document known false (?) positives and my intentions for them.

    Add/correct various medatada and support documentation.

    Eliminate last vestiges of the policy I started from.

    Comment on false positive found in Image-ExifTool and potential
    false positive found in `perldoc -f goto`. Also comment on all the
    cases I have found so far that DO warn, and add them to the .run
    file.
