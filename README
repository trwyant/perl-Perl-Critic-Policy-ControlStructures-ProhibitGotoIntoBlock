DESCRIPTION

This package contains a somewhat-slapdash attempt to detect cases where a
'goto LABEL;' transfers control into a block. This is unsupported, deprecated,
and will become fatal in Perl v5.44.

Perl::Critic is a prerequisite for this package. It is the intent that
the prerequisites of this package be those of Perl::Critic, so no extra
stuff should be needed.

INSTALLATION

This package is installable by either of the two usual incantations:

    tar -xzf \
	Perl-Critic-Policy-ControlStructures-ProhibitWhileDiamondDefaultWithoutLocal-9.999.tar
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

or

    tar -xzf \
	Perl-Critic-Policy-ControlStructures-ProhibitWhileDiamondDefaultWithoutLocal-9.999.tar
    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    sudo ./Build install

You should substitute the appropriate program name for 'make', eg nmake
(typically) under MSWin32, or mms or mmk under VMS. See
ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe for a copy of
nmake for MSWin32 if you need it.

Of course, since it's pure Perl, you can just expand the kit and drop
the .pm file into the Perl/Critic/Policy/Variables/ directory (creating
it if necessary) in the appropriate place in your @INC directories.
